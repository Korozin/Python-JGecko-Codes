# Python-JGecko-Codes
These are simply Python scripts that send cheats to Minecraft: Wii U Edition.

In order to run make sure "Common.py, Common.pyc, TCPGecko.py, and TCPGecko.pyc" are in the same folder so the modules will import correctly.
then simply run "python ScriptNameHere.py"

Note in order for it to work you MUST open the desired script in a text editor and place your Wii U's IPv4 where it says "192.168.1.97"
